# Awesome Rust Voxel Gamedev
## Libraries
- [ilattice3](https://github.com/bonsairobo/ilattice3) - data structures for storing and querying over 3d voxel lattices + bonus algorithms
 - [ilattice3-mesh](https://github.com/bonsairobo/ilattice3-mesh) - meshing algorithms for ilattice3
 - [ilattice3-procgen](https://github.com/bonsairobo/ilattice3-procgen) - procedural generation tools for ilattice3
- [building-blocks](https://github.com/bonsairobo/building-blocks) - 2D/3D agnostic lattice library/successor to ilattice3
- [amethyst-voxel](https://github.com/Kurble/amethyst_voxel) - voxels in amethyst **NO LONGER BEING DEVELOPED**
## Programs
- [Voxel Mapper](https://github.com/amethyst/voxel-mapper) - a voxel based tool/library for creating voxel worlds using amethyst+ilattice3
- [Minkraft](https://github.com/superdump/minkraft) - a WIP minecraft clone made using bevy+ilattice3
